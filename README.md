Societies is a game currently under development by Scorpion Games. We don't have a planned release date at the moment.

In Societies, you will explore the main island of Qasalia (working name) and talk with NPCs. You must integrate into society to receive a passport in each of the four countries.
Each country has a dfferent system of government (Capitalism, Anarchy, Collectivism, and Conformist) which greatly affect the requirements to get a passport in each country.
